"As a user I wanna Organization determine Expire time of Food"

That means when I am as an organization filling
the denoting form ,There wiil be a field to determine
the expire time of food.

Because:
--------
That will help to determine which charity will be able
to benefit from the food , and the trip that food will
take from the organization to the charity will not
destory the food or reduce its quality.

Example:
--------
Food with expiry time about two hours ,needs a nearest 
charity that the road to it is less than two hour
than one that is far.
